      "Be your own renaissance, your muse, your motivation to excel while the rest of the world winds down. Get up each morning with the intent of doing better than you did the day before. Proudly wear the colors that represent who you are and never take them off. Stand in, to stand out. \n\nIn this incredible collaboration with SuperRare, I've been honored to be given total freedom and control over exactly what and how I wanted to represent myself and my community. My people, my family, and my ancestors has never had a history of dead minimalism. Whenever we stepped out the front door, there was an intent - Each color had a meaning and mission. Mixing my love for expression and my Californian roots, I wanted to create something that was fun for the beach but was also badass enough to command a conference room. So this is me, handed over to you. ",
